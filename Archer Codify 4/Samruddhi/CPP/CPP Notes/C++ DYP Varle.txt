	Data Types --> Needed for memory allocation

							 |----> Data structure --> std.algo
	int		Array		structure =====> |
	char  ====> 	pointer	====> 	union		 |----> C++ prog --> allows you to store
	float				enum				     the data in secure   	
	double								     manner 	


	To store the data in secure manner the c++ introduced a new data type called class.
	It is next to structure.
		Basically the class is taken from language simula67 and Bjarne stroustrup
	from AT&T Bell Lab, USA, forms a new language called "C With Class" and later on
	It is renamed as C++, as a incremented version of C.

	The are some basic differences, lets see one by one

	- In C, some header files are included by default (stdio.h, stdlib.h....)
	  but in C++, No any header file included by default.

	- There are predefined input and output streams. from wic
		- cin is predefined input stream
		- cout is predefined output stream

	// C++ Welcome Program

	Before proceeding further, we must know about the output stream.
	To display the data on screen cout is used

	syntax:
		cout<<"<format_String>";

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout<<"Welcome to C++ Programming";
	return 0;
}


	- return type int: C does not return anything to OS, so the returning
		   type of main() in C is void but In C++, int value
			   0 returned to OS, therefore the return type of main()
			   is int and 0 indicated sucessful execution.	   

	- cout:Basically it is prdfefined output stream, It is actually the object of
			 ostream class. It is defined in iostream.h so you need to include it
			 @top of main. 

	- Insertion Operator(<<): The operator << is bitwise Leftshift operator
			 here it is overloaded, and additionally when it is used with cout
			 it will put the data on screen and terefore it is known as the
			 put to or insertion operator.


 //=====================================================================================

	// Simple cout demo program with basic fomating

#include<iostream.h>
#include<iomanip.h>
int main()
{
	cout<<endl<<"Good Morning"<<endl<<"Work Hard";

	int x=10,y=12;
	float ft=56.43;
	
	cout<<"\n Value of x and y is: "<<x<<setw(10)<<y;
	cout<<endl<<"Value of x is: "<<x<<endl<<"Value of y="<<y
		<<"\t ft="<<setprecision(4)<<ft;

	return 0;
}

  Note:
	- endl is manipulator, which inserts the newline (\n or any other escape sequence character)
	  allowed here)

	- C++ allows to decl. the variables anywere in the program, but it must be decleared
	  before using it.

	- In C++, We dont need format specifiers, it will take the type automatically.
	  and while displaying the stream manipulators, identifiers, strings must be seperated
	  using<<
	
	- cout<<"xxxx"; It can be expanded within one or more lines.

	- setprecision() To set the width setw() and for precision setprecision() 
	  is used and both are defined in iomanip.h

 //==============================================================================================

	Now after the basic IO we will start in a sequence.

	 character set ==> Tokens --> instructions --> program


	- character is same coz it it actually c with class.

	- Tokens: It is smallest individual unit in the program

		- constant
		- keyword (48 keywords)
		- identifier
		- strings
		- operators

	Now, lets start with data type,

		/// C++ Data Types

	Data type is tool which is needed for the memory allocation and i is referred at the
	time of memory allocation in type decl.

	  - structure                   |		      - Array

		    int          char        float      double 



	// Data input in C++: 

	Here, cin, which is pre-defined object of istream class and it is from the
	iostream.h, used as a input stream. and the operator >> is used as get in
	operator or also known as extraction operator, used totake a data input.
	basically it is bitwise right-shift operatorwhich is overloaded here.

	syntax:
		cin>> <var_nm>;

		e.g.
			int x;
			cin>>x;

			int a;
			float b;
			double d;
			cin>>a>>b>>d;

	Note that it will not require & to get an address, it is gained automatically by the cin.	

 Lets see one example:

int main()
{
	cout<<"\n The Example of Data Input"<<endl;
	
	int a,b;
	cout<<"\n Enter any two int values: ";
	cin>>a>>b;

	cout<<endl<<"Enter two fractional values: ";
	float f;
	double d;
	cin>>f>>d;

	cout<<endl<<" a="<<a<<"\t b="<<b;
	cout<<endl<<"f="<<f<<"\t d="<<d;

	return 0;
}
