In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow:

Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

3
Sample Output 0

Weird
Sample Input 1

24
Sample Output 1

Not Weird
Explanation

Sample Case 0: 
 is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1: 
 and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.

        {
             System.out.println("Not Weird");
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}

Explanation

Sample Case 0: 
 n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1: 
 n>20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.

Explaination


scanner.nextInt() reads an integer N from the user.

scanner.skip(...) ensures that any newline or special characters after the integer input are ignored.

The program uses if-else blocks to evaluate N against the conditions:
If 𝑁%2≠0, the number is odd, and the program prints "Weird".
If 𝑁%2=0(even)N lies between 2 and 5 inclusive, the program prints "Not Weird".
If N%2=0 (even) and N lies between 6 and 20 inclusive, the program prints "Weird".
If N%2=0 (even) and N is greater than 20, the program prints "Not Weird".
