            <h1>The Land of Earth - Iwagakure</h1>
            <p>The Land of Earth (土の国, Tsuchi no Kuni) has seen little attention in the series thus far. It is located north-west of the Land of Fire. Its government leader is the Earth Daimyō. The country is mostly comprised of desolate, rocky areas. The border of the Land of Earth runs along a rocky mountain range, blocking communication with other countries. The wind blowing from the north passes over these mountains, carrying small rocks from the Land of Earth to the surrounding countries. This famous natural phenomenon is called "Rock Rain" (岩雨, Gan'u).</p>
            
            <h1>The Land of lightning  - kumogakure</h1>
            <p>The Land of Lightning (雷の国, Kaminari no Kuni) is located on a peninsula north-east of the Land of Fire and is one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries. Its government leader is the Lightning Daimyō. In the centre of the country are vast mountain ranges, whose many thunderstorms are said to give the country its name. From these mountain ranges, many rivers flow to the sea, creating a very crooked coastline that displays an impressive oceanic beauty. There are many hot springs located within the country. The country's western border with the Land of Frost has a large desert.[7]</p>
            
            <h1>The Land of Water - Kirigakure</h1>
            <p>The Land of Water (水の国, Mizu no Kuni) also known as the "Land of Mist" (霧の国, Kiri no Kuni).[9][10] It is composed of many islands, with each having its own unique traditions. The country's weather is typically cool and the islands are usually covered by mist. The islands themselves also feature many lakes. In some places, like the area where Haku grew up, it is very cold and snows quite a bit. The nation is oriented towards the element of water. Its government leader is the Water Daimyō.</p>
            
            <h1>The Land of Wind - Sunagakure</h1>
            <p>The Land of Wind (風の国, Kaze no Kuni) is one of the more prominent countries in the series. It is located to the south-west of the Land of Fire and borders the Land of Rivers and Amegakure. Its government leader is the Wind Daimyō. The country covers a vast realm, but is significantly composed of deserts and thus has little productivity.[11] Because there is very little rainfall throughout the year, the people of the country live in villages built on one of the desert's many oases. </p>
            
            <h1>The Land of Fire - Konohagakure.</h1>
            <p>The Land of Iron (鉄の国, Tetsu no Kuni) is an icy, snow-covered country located among three mountains called the Three Wolves (三狼, Sanrō). Unlike other countries of the world whose militaries use shinobi, the Land of Iron's military is made up of samurai. Due to the differing ideologies between shinobi and samurai – as well as the fact that the Land of Iron's samurai are quite formidable – there is an agreement among shinobi not to interfere with the Land of Iron.[6]s</p>
