			The Great Ninja War, also known as the First Shinobi World War, 
            was the first major conflict between the Five Great Shinobi Countries. 
            The war was caused by the countries and their hidden villages taking resources from other countries. 
            The war resulted in chaos and damaged each of the Five Great Shinobi Countries. After the war, 
            an armistice treaty was signed, establishing 20 years of peace.
