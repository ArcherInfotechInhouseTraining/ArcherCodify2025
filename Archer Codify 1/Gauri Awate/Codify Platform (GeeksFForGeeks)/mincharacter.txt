Problem:
Given a string s1 and another string s2. Find the minimum index of the character in s1 that is also present in s2.

Examples :

Input: s1 = "geeksforgeeks", s2 = "set"
Output: 1
Explanation: e is the character which is present in given s1 "geeksforgeeks" and is also present in s2 "set". Minimum index of e is 1. 
Input: s1 = "adcffaet", s2 = "onkl"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are none of the characters which is common in s1 and s2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 105 
'a' <= s1i, s2i <= 'z'

Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
class Solution {
  public:
        int minIndexChar(string &s1, string &s2) {
         for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
        
        for (int j = 0; j < s2.length(); j++) {
            if (s1[i] == s2[j]) {
                return i;
            }
        }
    }
    return -1; 
    }
};
int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        string str;
        string patt;
        cin >> str;
        cin >> patt;
        Solution obj;
        cout << obj.minIndexChar(str, patt) << endl;

        cout << "~"
             << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
