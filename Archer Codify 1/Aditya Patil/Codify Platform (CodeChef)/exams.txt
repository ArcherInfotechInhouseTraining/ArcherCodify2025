In Chefland, there are X schools, and each school has Y students.
The year end results are in and a total of Z students passed the exams.

Assuming that all students appeared for the exams, find whether the number of students who passed in Chefland was strictly greater than 50%.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers X,Y, and Z, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the total number of students who passed in Chefland was strictly greater than 50%, otherwise print NO.
