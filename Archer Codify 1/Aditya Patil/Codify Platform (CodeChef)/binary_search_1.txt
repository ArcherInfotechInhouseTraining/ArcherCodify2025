Chef belongs to a very rich family which owns many gold mines. Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange?

Chef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:

He puts 1 coin in the 1st row.
then puts 2 coins in the 2nd row.
then puts 3 coins in the 3rd row.
and so on as shown in the given figure.
Chef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?
