Title:- Cricket Balls to Overs!
        In cricket, an over consists of six deliveries a bowler bowls from one end. Create a function that takes the number of nBalls bowled by a bowler and calculates the number of overs bowled by him/her.

Examples
totalOvers(2400) ➞ [400]

totalOvers(164) ➞ [27.2]
// 27 overs and 2 balls were bowled by the bowler.

totalOvers(945) ➞ [157.3]
// 157 overs and 3 balls were bowled by the bowler.

totalOvers(5) ➞ [0.5]

Solution:- 


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
float totalOvers(int nBalls) {
	
	int over=nBalls/6;
	
	int balls= nBalls%6;
	
	double result= over + balls/10.0;
	return result;
}
int main()
{
	int balls;
	
	cout<<"Enter the Balls:"<<endl;
	cin>>balls;
	
	cout<<"Total Overs Played is :"<<totalOvers(balls)<<endl;
	
	return 0;
	
}
