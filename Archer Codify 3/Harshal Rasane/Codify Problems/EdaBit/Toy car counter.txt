Title:- Toy Car Workshop
        You work in a toy car workshop, and your job is to build toy cars from a collection of parts. Each toy car needs 4 wheels, 1 car body, and 2 figures of people to be placed inside. Given the total number of wheels, car bodies and figures available, how many complete toy cars can you make?

Examples
cars(2, 48, 76) ➞ 0
// 2 wheels, 48 car bodies, 76 figures

cars(43, 15, 87) ➞ 10

cars(88, 37, 17) ➞ 8

Approch:- algorithm name library are used to import min() function.

Solution:-

#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;

int cars(int wheels, int bodies, int figures) {
	if(wheels || bodies || figures !=0)
	{
		return min({wheels/4, bodies, figures/2});
	}
	else{
		return 0;
	}
	
	}
int main()
{
    int wheel;
    int bodie;
    int fig;
    
    cout<<"Enter the Wheels, Bodies, Figures:"<<endl;
    cin>>wheel>>bodie>>fig;
    
    cout<<"Total Complete cars are made is :"<<cars(wheel, bodie, fig);
    
    return 0;
}
