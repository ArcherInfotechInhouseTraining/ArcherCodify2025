Title:- Introduction
A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

In every year that is evenly divisible by 4.
Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it's only a leap year if the year is also evenly divisible by 400.


Some examples:

1997 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 4.
1900 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 400.
2000 was a leap year!

Solution:- 

import java.util.Scanner;
class Leap {

    static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
        if (year%4==0)
        {
            if(year%100==0){
                return year%400==0;
            }
            else{
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = sc.nextInt();
        if(Leap.isLeapYear(i)== true)
        {
            System.out.println("This is a Leap Year.");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("This is not a Leap Year.");
        }
