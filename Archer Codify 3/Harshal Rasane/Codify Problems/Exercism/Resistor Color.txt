Title:- If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use resistors. For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:

Each resistor has a resistance value.
Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.
To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values. Each band has a position and a numeric value.

The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number.

In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.

These colors are encoded as follows:

black: 0
brown: 1
red: 2
orange: 3
yellow: 4
green: 5
blue: 6
violet: 7
grey: 8
white: 9
The goal of this exercise is to create a way:

to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band
to list the different band colors

Solution:-

import java.util.*;

class ResistorColor {
    private final String[] colorCodes={"black", "brown", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "grey", "white"};

    public int colorCode(String color){
        for(int i=0;i<colorCodes.length;i++){
            if(colorCodes[i].equals(color)){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    public List<String> colors() {
        return Arrays.asList(colorCodes);
    }
}
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ResistorColor ob =new ResistorColor();
        
        String testColor="brown";
        int value=ob.colorCode(testColor);
        
        if(value!=-1){
            System.out.println("The color code for " + testColor + " is: " + value);
        }else{
            System.out.println("Color not found: " + testColor);
        }
        
        System.out.println("\nList of all resistor color bands:");
        List<String> allColors = ob.colors();
        for (String color : allColors) {
            System.out.println(color);
        }
    }
}
