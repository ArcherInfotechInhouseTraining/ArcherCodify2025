Title :- Calculate the points scored in a single toss of a Darts game.

Darts is a game where players throw darts at a target.

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

Our dart scoreboard with values from a complete miss to a bullseye

If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.
The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

solution:- 


class Darts {
    int score(double x, double y) {
        double distance=Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y);

        if(distance>10){
            return 0;
        }else if(distance>5){
            return 1;
        }else if(distance>1){
            return 5;
        }else{
            return 10;
        }
    }
   
}
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Darts ob= new Darts();
        System.out.println(ob.score(input, input));
    }
}
