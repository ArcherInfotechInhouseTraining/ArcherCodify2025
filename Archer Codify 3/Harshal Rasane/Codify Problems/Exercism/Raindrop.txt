Title :- Your task is to convert a number into its corresponding raindrop sounds.

If a given number:

is divisible by 3, add "Pling" to the result.
is divisible by 5, add "Plang" to the result.
is divisible by 7, add "Plong" to the result.
is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string.


Examples:-
28 is divisible by 7, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".

Solution:- 

class RaindropConverter {

    String convert(int number) {
        if(number%3==0 && number%5==0 && number%7==0){
            return "PlingPlangPlong";
        }else if(number%3==0 && number%5==0){
            return "PlingPlang";
        }else if(number%3==0 && number%7==0){
            return "PlingPlong";
        }else if(number%5==0 && number%7==0){
            return "PlangPlong";
        }else if(number%3==0){
            return "Pling";
        }else if(number%5==0){
            return "Plang";
        }else if(number%7==0){
            return "Plong";
        }else {
            return String.valueOf(number);
        }
    }
}

class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        RaindropConverter ob= new RaindropConverter();
        System.out.println(ob.convert(105));
        
    }
}
