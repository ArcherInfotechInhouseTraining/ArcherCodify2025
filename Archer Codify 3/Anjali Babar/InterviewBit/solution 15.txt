Title: You are given two strings, A and B, separated by a new line. Each string will consist of lower case Latin characters (‘a’-‘z’).

Output three lines:

First line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of A and B respectively.
Second line print the string produced by concatenating A and B (A+B).
Third line print two strings separated by a space, A' and B'. A' and B' are the same as A and B, respectively, except that their first characters are swapped.
Sample input:

abcd
ef
Sample Output:

4 2
abcdef
ebcd af

Solution: 
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int main()  {
    string A, B;
    cin>>A>>B;
    // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    // Print the lengths of A and B
    cout << A.length() << " " << B.length() << endl;

    // Print the concatenated string A + B
    cout << A + B << endl;

    // Swap the first characters of A and B
    // Create new strings A' and B' with swapped first characters
    if (!A.empty() && !B.empty()) {
        string A_prime = B[0] + A.substr(1); 
        string B_prime = A[0] + B.substr(1); 
        cout << A_prime << " " << B_prime << endl;
    }

    return 0;
