
Chef invented a modified wordle.

There is a hidden word S and a guess word T, both of length 5.

Chef defines a string M to determine the correctness of the guess word. For the ith index:

If the guess at the ith index is correct, the ith character of M is G.
If the guess at the ith index is wrong, the ith character of M is B.
Given the hidden word S and guess T, determine string M.

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    string s,t,m="";
	    cin>>s;
	    cin>>t;
	for(int i =0;i<5;i++){
	 
	        if(s[i]==t[i])
	            m+="G";
	        
	        else
	            m+="B";
	        }
	    
	cout<<m<<"\n";
	}
