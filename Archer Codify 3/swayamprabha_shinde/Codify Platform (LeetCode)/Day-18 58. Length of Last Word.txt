58. Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only. 

Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

Solution:

public class LastWordLength {
    public static int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int length = 0;
        boolean isWord = false;

        // Traverse the string from the end
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // If we find a non-space character, start counting
            if (s.charAt(i) != ' ') {
                length++;
                isWord = true;
            }
            // If we encounter a space after counting a word, break
            else if (isWord) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return length;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        String s1 = "Hello World";
        String s2 = "   fly me   to   the moon  ";
        String s3 = "luffy is still joyboy";

        System.out.println("Output 1: " + lengthOfLastWord(s1)); 
        System.out.println("Output 2: " + lengthOfLastWord(s2)); 
        System.out.println("Output 3: " + lengthOfLastWord(s3)); 
    }
}

Explanation:

length: Keeps track of the length of the last word.
isWord: A flag to indicate whether we’ve started counting the last word. This helps to handle cases where there are trailing spaces in the string.
We loop backward through the string, starting from the last character (s.length() - 1) and stopping at the first character (i >= 0).
s.charAt(i) != ' ': If the current character is not a space, it is part of a word.
Increment length to count the character.
Set isWord = true to indicate that we’ve started counting a word.
If we encounter a space after starting to count the last word (isWord == true), we stop the loop using break.
This ensures that we only count the last word and not anything before it.
length contains the number of characters in the last word.
