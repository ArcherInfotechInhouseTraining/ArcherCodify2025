485. Max Consecutive Ones

Title:
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3

Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

Approach Used/Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

Solution: 
class Solution {
    // Method to find the maximum number of consecutive 1's
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int maxCount = 0;
        int currentCount = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                currentCount++;
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, currentCount);
            } else {
                currentCount = 0;
            }
        }
        return maxCount;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1};

        Solution ob = new Solution();

        int result = ob.findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums);

        System.out.println("Maximum consecutive 1's: " + result);
    }
}                                                                                     

output :                                                                                          [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1]                                                                                                                                                                               5                                                                                    
Expected : 5

- maxCount: Keeps track of the highest number of consecutive 1s found so far in the array.
- currentCount: Tracks the current streak of consecutive 1s as the array is traversed.
- For Each Element (num):
         If num == 1:
              Increment currentCount since the streak of consecutive 1s continues.
              Update maxCount to the larger value between maxCount and currentCount.
         If num == 0:
              Reset currentCount to 0 since the streak of 1s is broken.
- After iterating through the array, maxCount holds the maximum number of consecutive 1s and is returned as the result.
