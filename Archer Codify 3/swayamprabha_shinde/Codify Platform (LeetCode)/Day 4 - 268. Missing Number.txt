268. Missing Number

title:
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2


Explanation:
n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

solution:

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {

        int n = nums.length;
            
            int totalsum = n*(n+1)/2;

            int arraysum = 0;

            for(int num : nums)
            {
               arraysum = arraysum + num;
            }

             return totalsum-arraysum;
        } 

    public static void main(String args[]){

        int nums[] = {4,7,8,3,2,6,9,1};

        Solution ob = new Solution();

        int missingno = ob.missingNumber(nums);

        System.out.println(" "+ missingno);
    }
}

output:
Input
nums =[9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output
8
Expected
8

Explanation:

Missing Number: The missing number is the difference between the total sum and the sum of the array elements.

Formula for Total Sum: The sum of the first 𝑛  natural numbers is given by the formula:
sum = sum*(sum+1)/2

Array Sum: The sum of the elements in the array is calculated using a loop.
