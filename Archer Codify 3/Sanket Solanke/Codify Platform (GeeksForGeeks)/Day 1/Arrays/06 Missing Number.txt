*Title:*
You are given an array arr of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

*Example:*
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.

*Solution:*

// User function Template for Java
class Solution {
    int missingNumber(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int len = arr.length+1;
        int tot = (len)*(len+1)/2;
        for(int i=0; i<len-1; i++)
        {
            tot-=arr[i];
        }
        
        return tot;
    }
}

*Test Cases:*
For Input: 
1 2 3 5
Your Output: 
4
Expected Output: 
4


*Algo:*
1. Calculate the length of array & add 1(for missing value).
2. Calculate sum of all numbers from 1 tp length *n(n+1)/2*.
3. Subtract each value from the calculated sum.
4. We will be remained with the value of missing element
