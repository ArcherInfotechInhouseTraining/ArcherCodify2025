        <h1>Animals</h1>
        <p> Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia 
With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. 
Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor.</p>
