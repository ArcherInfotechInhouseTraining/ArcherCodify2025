    <h1>computer</h1>
    <p>
        A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.
        Before we talk about different types of computers, let's talk about two things all computers have in common: hardware and software.

        Hardware is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts, which you can see in the image below
        Everything you do on your computer will rely on both hardware and software. For example, right now you may be viewing this lesson in a web browser (software) and using your mouse (hardware) to click from page to page. As you learn about different types of computers, ask yourself about the differences in their hardware. As you progress through this tutorial, you'll see that different types of computers also often use different types of software.
    </p>
    <h1>Computer  Hardware</h1>
    <p>Computer hardware refers to the tangible components of a computer system that work together to execute tasks and processes. The Central Processing Unit (CPU), often called the "brain" of the computer, performs all calculations and controls other parts, working alongside the Random Access Memory (RAM), which provides temporary storage for data that the CPU actively uses. The motherboard acts as the backbone, connecting the CPU, memory, storage devices, and peripherals, ensuring seamless communication between them. For long-term storage, devices like Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs) store the operating system, applications, and data. Graphics are handled by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which generates visuals for games, videos, and other applications. Input devices like keyboards and mice allow users to interact with the computer, while output devices such as monitors and printers display or produce results. Power to all these components is supplied by the Power Supply Unit (PSU). Additionally, cooling systems, like fans or liquid coolers, prevent components from overheating. Together, these hardware elements form a complete system, enabling a computer to function effectively for various tasks, from basic word processing to advanced machine learning algorithms.
     </p>
     <h1>Computer  Software</h1>
     <p>
        Computer Software refers to the set of instructions, programs, or data that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. Unlike hardware, software is intangible and operates as the "brain" behind the physical components, enabling them to work efficiently. Software is broadly categorized into System Software, Application Software, and Programming Software.

System Software includes the Operating System (OS), like Windows, macOS, or Linux, which acts as an intermediary between hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources, runs applications, and provides essential services such as file management, task scheduling, and security. Examples include device drivers and utility software.

Application Software is designed for end-users to perform specific tasks like word processing, gaming, or browsing the internet. Examples are Microsoft Office, web browsers, and video editing tools.

Programming Software helps developers create programs and applications. This category includes text editors, compilers, debuggers, and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse or Visual Studio.

Computer software evolves constantly, adapting to user needs and technological advancements. Together with hardware, it forms the backbone of any functional computer system.
