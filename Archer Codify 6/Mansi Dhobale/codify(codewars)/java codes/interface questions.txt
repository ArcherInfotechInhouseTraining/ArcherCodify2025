Easy Questions (Beginner/Basic Level)
These questions typically focus on basic concepts of interfaces, their syntax, and their purpose in programming. You’ll likely encounter these in initial rounds, especially for entry-level positions or internships.

What is an interface in Java (or C#, or any OOP language)?

Answer: An interface in object-oriented programming is a contract that specifies the methods a class must implement without providing any implementation details. It only defines the method signatures. For example, in Java, an interface can be created using the interface keyword.
What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?

Answer: An interface defines only method signatures and constants. It cannot contain instance variables or concrete methods (until recent Java versions, where default and static methods were allowed). An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods, and it may have member variables and constructors.
How do you implement an interface in Java (or C#)?

Answer: A class implements an interface by using the implements keyword in Java. For example:
java
Copy code
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
Can an interface be instantiated?

Answer: No, an interface cannot be instantiated directly. An interface defines the methods, but the instantiation must be done by a class that implements the interface.
Medium Questions (Intermediate Level)
These questions test your understanding of how to use interfaces effectively in different scenarios, and might involve applying interfaces in problem-solving or understanding advanced concepts.

What is multiple inheritance in the context of interfaces? How does it work in Java?

Answer: In Java, a class can implement multiple interfaces, which is a form of multiple inheritance. This allows a class to inherit behavior from more than one interface. Unlike multiple inheritance of classes (which Java does not allow), interfaces provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance.
Example:
java
Copy code
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}
interface Mammal {
    void giveBirth();
}
class Human implements Animal, Mammal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating");
    }
    public void giveBirth() {
        System.out.println("Giving Birth");
    }
}
Can an interface extend another interface?

Answer: Yes, an interface can extend another interface. When an interface extends another, it inherits the abstract methods of the parent interface, and any class implementing the child interface must implement all inherited methods.
Example:
java
Copy code
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}
interface Mammal extends Animal {
    void giveBirth();
}
What is the purpose of default methods in interfaces (Java 8+)?

Answer: Java 8 introduced default methods in interfaces. A default method is a method in an interface with a body. It allows you to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. This is useful for adding functionality to interfaces in libraries while maintaining backward compatibility.
Can a class implement multiple interfaces with conflicting method signatures?

Answer: If two interfaces declare the same method signature, the implementing class must provide a concrete implementation for that method. If the method bodies differ, the class needs to resolve the conflict. Java allows this through method overriding.
Example:
java
Copy code
interface A {
    void doSomething();
}
interface B {
    void doSomething();
}
class C implements A, B {
    public void doSomething() {
        // resolve conflict by providing implementation
    }
}
Hard Questions (Advanced Level)
These questions typically require deep knowledge of object-oriented principles, design patterns, and advanced use cases involving interfaces.

How would you design an interface for a payment system that supports multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.)?

Answer: This is a design question where you need to create an interface that can be implemented by different payment methods. The key is to define common operations like authorizePayment(), capturePayment(), etc., and allow flexibility for specific payment types.
Example:
java
Copy code
interface PaymentMethod {
    boolean authorizePayment(double amount);
    boolean capturePayment(double amount);
}
class CreditCard implements PaymentMethod {
    public boolean authorizePayment(double amount) {
        // Credit card authorization logic
        return true;
    }
    public boolean capturePayment(double amount) {
        // Credit card capture logic
        return true;
    }
}
class PayPal implements PaymentMethod {
    public boolean authorizePayment(double amount) {
        // PayPal authorization logic
        return true;
    }
    public boolean capturePayment(double amount) {
        // PayPal capture logic
        return true;
    }
}
Explain how the interface segregation principle (ISP) applies in object-oriented design.

Answer: The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. In the context of interfaces, this means breaking down large, monolithic interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, so that classes only need to implement the interfaces relevant to their behavior.
Example:
java
Copy code
interface Printer {
    void print();
}
interface Scanner {
    void scan();
}
class MultiFunctionPrinter implements Printer, Scanner {
    public void print() {
        // Printing logic
    }
    public void scan() {
        // Scanning logic
    }
}
What is the role of interfaces in the strategy design pattern?

Answer: In the Strategy design pattern, interfaces are used to define a family of algorithms (strategies) that can be selected dynamically at runtime. The strategy interface defines the common method, and each concrete strategy implements that method in its own way.
Example:
java
Copy code
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(double amount);
}
class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        // Credit card payment logic
    }
}
class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(double amount) {
        // PayPal payment logic
    }
}
class PaymentContext {
    private PaymentStrategy strategy;
    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }
    public void executePayment(double amount) {
        strategy.pay(amount);
    }
}
How would you handle backward compatibility when modifying an interface with new methods?

Answer: One way to handle backward compatibility is to use default methods in Java 8+. If you add new methods to an interface, these methods can have a default implementation that doesn’t break existing implementations. Alternatively, you could introduce new interfaces or version the API to ensure older versions still work.
Conclusion:
Interview questions on interfaces can range from basic syntax questions to complex design challenges. For easy questions, you’ll deal with basic definitions, syntax, and simple use cases. Medium questions often involve applying interfaces in real-world problems or touching on advanced features like multiple inheritance or default methods. Hard questions demand a deep understanding of object-oriented principles and design patterns, and require applying interfaces to create scalable and maintainable software systems.

1. What is an interface in Java?

Ans: An interface in Java is a mechanism that is used to achieve complete abstraction. It is basically a kind of class that contains only constants and abstract methods.

2. Can we define private and protected modifiers for data members (fields) in interfaces?

Ans: No, we cannot define private and protected modifiers for variables in interface because the fields (data members) declared in an interface are by default public, static, and final.

3. Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an Interface?

Ans: Only abstract and public modifiers are allowed for methods in interfaces.

4. Suppose A is an interface. Can we create an object using new A()?

Ans: No, we cannot create an object of interface using new operator. But we can create a reference of interface type and interface reference refers to objects of its implementation classes.

5. Can we define an interface with a static modifier?

Ans: Yes, from Java 8 onwards, we can define static and default methods in an interface. Prior to Java 8, it was not allowed.

6. Suppose A is an interface. Can we declare a reference variable a with type A like this: A a;

Ans: Yes.

7. Can an interface extends another interface in Java?

Ans: Yes, an interface can extend another interface.

8. Can an interface implement another interface?

Ans: No, an interface cannot implement another interface.

1. What is an interface in Java and how is it different from a class?
Interviewers may start your interview with basic questions before asking advanced questions. They may ask this question to assess your understanding of fundamental Java programming concepts and your ability to implement them. An accurate response can help you demonstrate your knowledge of the functions.
Example answer: "An interface is a collection of abstract methods, which means they do not have a body. You can only implement them in a class. A class that implements an interface requires concrete implementation for all the interface's methods. A class can have both abstract and concrete methods and can also have fields and constructors. It can also inherit from a single superclass, in which case it can implement multiple interfaces."

2. How do you define methods in an interface?
Defining methods in an interface is a crucial aspect of Java programming, as it establishes the contract, which classes that implement the interface fulfil. By asking about the definition of methods in an interface, interviewers aim to assess your knowledge of Java syntax, your understanding of object-oriented design principles, and your ability to write clear and maintainable code.
Example answer: "In an interface, you can define methods by using the interface keyword, followed by the method name, return type and parameters. It is unnecessary to define the method body. The class that implements the interface automatically provides the method body. All methods that you define in an interface are implicitly public and abstract. There is no requirement to manually state that while defining a method."

3. How can you implement multiple interfaces in a single class?
Interviewers may ask this question to test your understanding of interface implementation in Java, specifically the concept of multiple inheritances. Implementing multiple interfaces in a single class is a common practice in Java programming and provides greater flexibility in code design. Explain the entire process in your response to show your extensive knowledge of the subject.
Example answer: "You can implement multiple interfaces in a single class using the implements keyword, followed by a list of interfaces that you wish to implement. When a class implements multiple interfaces, it provides an implementation for all the methods in those interfaces. The class can implement the methods in its own way, but it is necessary that it adheres to the method signatures in the interfaces. A class that implements multiple interfaces can also extend into a superclass using the extends keyword."

4. Can an interface have a constructor?
By asking about the presence of constructors in interfaces, interviewers aim to assess your knowledge of Java syntax and your ability to distinguish between different types of elements in the Java programming language. You can explain the function of constructors and why an interface cannot have one.
Example answer: "An interface in Java cannot have a constructor, as the primary function of constructors is to initialise the state of an object after its creation, and interfaces do not have a state. Interfaces typically define a contract for a set of methods that a class implements. You cannot initialise them. An interface can have only abstract methods and constant variables but not constructors or instance variables. It also cannot define any code inside the methods. You can only use them to describe the signature of the method."

5. What is the use of the marker interface in Java?
Knowing how to use marker interfaces can help you display advanced knowledge of Java interfaces during your interview. Your response to this question can help the interviewer assess your understanding of the purpose and usage of interfaces in Java and your knowledge of advanced Java concepts and libraries. If the recruiter asks this question, respond by explaining what a marker interface is and provide examples to support the definition.
Example answer: "A marker interface is one that has no methods or fields, and its main purpose is to serve as a marker or tag for a class. An example of such an interface is the cloneable interface. It indicates that you can clone an object of a class. When you pass an object of a class that implements the cloneable interface to its clone method, it creates a new copy of the object. Marker interfaces can be helpful in defining certain properties or behaviours for a class. They can show that a class has a specific capability."

6. What is polymorphism in Java?
Interviewers ask this question to evaluate your understanding of polymorphism, one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming. Interviewers may aim to assess your understanding of object-oriented design principles and your knowledge of Java syntax and programming concepts. Your answer to this question can provide the interviewer with an understanding of your ability to articulate complex technical concepts in a clear and concise manner.
Example answer: "In Java, polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. One way to achieve this in Java is by using interfaces. An interface defines a contract for a set of methods that a class implements. When a class implements an interface, it can provide its own implementation for the methods in the interface. This means that multiple classes can implement the same interface and provide their own unique implementation for the interface's methods."

7. How does the interface handle inheritance and polymorphism?
This might be a follow-up question to the previous one. The interviewer may ask this to understand if you have extensive knowledge of the subject. This can be a good chance for you to demonstrate how well you understand polymorphism and inheritance and know how an interface handles both. In your response, explain ways in which an interface handles both inheritance and polymorphism.
Example answer: "Interfaces in Java handle both inheritance and polymorphism in different ways. They handle inheritance through interface implementation. A class can implement one or more interfaces, and by doing so, it inherits the methods and fields in those interfaces. The class provides an implementation for all the methods in the interfaces it implements, and it can also define its own methods and fields.
Interfaces provide a way for multiple classes to share a common set of methods while handling polymorphism. They also do the same for objects of those classes, where a single method call can produce different results depending on the actual type of the object."

8. Can an interface extend another interface?
By asking about the ability of an interface to extend another interface, interviewers aim to assess your understanding of interface inheritance and your knowledge of Java syntax and programming concepts. This can help them better test your comprehension of interfaces. In your response, state whether an interface can extend another interface and explain how.
Example answer: "Yes, an interface can extend one or more other interfaces using the extends keyword. When an interface extends another one, it inherits all the methods and fields defined in the parent interface. It can also define its own methods and fields."
9. How can you prevent a class from implementing an interface?
An interviewer may ask this question to test the extent of your understanding of classes and interfaces in Java. To answer the question, talk about the ways in which you can prevent a class from implementing an interface and explain them in detail.
Example answer: "There are various ways in which you can prevent a class from implementing an interface. You can declare a class as final, which prevents that class from extending. This inhibits it from implementing an interface. You can also create an annotation with the retention policy of the class and add this annotation to the class that you want to prevent from implementing an interface. Another way is to use a sealed class. A sealed class can specify which classes can extend or implement that sealed class."
