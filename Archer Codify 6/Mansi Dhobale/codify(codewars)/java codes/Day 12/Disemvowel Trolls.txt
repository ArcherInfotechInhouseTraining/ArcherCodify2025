Problem:
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

Code:

#include <stdlib.h>

//solution must allocate all required memory
//and return a free-able buffer to the caller.

int vowel(char c)
{

  if ( 
    (c == 'a') || (c == 'e') || (c == 'i') || (c == 'o') || (c == 'u') ||
    (c == 'A') || (c == 'E') || (c == 'I') || (c == 'O') || (c == 'U')
    )
  {
    return 1;
  }
  else
  { 
    return 0;
  }  
}

char *disemvowel(const char *str)
{
    char *rst = (char *) malloc( sizeof(char) * (strlen(str)+1) );
    const char *p = str;
    int idx = 0;
    
    while(p != NULL && *p != '\0')
    {      
      if(!vowel(*p))
      {
        rst[idx] = *p;
        idx++;
      }
      p++;      
    }    
    rst[idx] = '\0';    
    return rst;
}
