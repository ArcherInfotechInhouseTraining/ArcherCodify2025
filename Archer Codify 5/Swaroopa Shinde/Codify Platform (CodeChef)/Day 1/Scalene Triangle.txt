Scalene Triangle
Given A,B, and C as the sides of a triangle, find whether the triangle is scalene.

Note:

A triangle is said to be scalene if all three sides of the triangle are distinct.
It is guaranteed that the sides represent a valid triangle.

Solution :

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int a,b,c;
        cin>>a>>b>>c;
         cout<<(a<b && b<c ?"Yes" : "No")<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
