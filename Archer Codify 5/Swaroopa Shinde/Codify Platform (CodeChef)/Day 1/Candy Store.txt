Candy Store
Chef has started working at the candy store. The store has 100 chocolates in total.

Chef’s daily goal is to sell X chocolates. 
For each chocolate sold, he will get 
1 rupee. However, if Chef exceeds his daily goal, he gets 
2 rupees per chocolate for each extra chocolate.

If Chef sells 
Y chocolates in a day, find the total amount he made.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
X and Y — the daily goal of Chef, and the number of chocolates he actually sells.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the total amount Chef made in a day.

Output:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int x,y;
        cin>>x>>y;
       if(x>=y)
       {
           cout<<y<<endl;
       }
       else
       {
           cout<<(x+(y-x)*2)<<endl;
       }
    }
	return 0;
