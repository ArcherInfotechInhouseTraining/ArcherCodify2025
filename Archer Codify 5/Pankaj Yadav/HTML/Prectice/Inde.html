    <h1>Harshad</h1>
    <p>
        Harshad Mehta was a stockbroker who manipulated stock prices in India in the 1990s, causing a major stock market crash. Here are some details about the Harshad Mehta scam: 
How it happened: Mehta illegally obtained money from banks using fake receipts and created a cycle of fraud. The State Bank of Saurashtra paid Rs 174.95 crore for securities it never received, and the money went to Mehta's accounts instead. 
The impact: The scam was a major incident in India's financial history. 
The aftermath: A book was written about Mehta's life, and a web series and film were also made. The film, The Big Bull, starring Abhishek Bachchan, increased interest in the story.

    <h1>Harshal</h1>
    <p>
        Harshal wandered through the dense forest, the sunlight barely piercing the thick canopy above. The air was cool, filled with the earthy aroma of damp leaves and the distant sound of a babbling brook. As he moved deeper into the woods, the silence grew, interrupted only by the occasional chirp of a bird or the rustle of unseen creatures.
