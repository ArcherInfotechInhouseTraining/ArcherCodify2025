       <b> Harshad Mehta was a stockbroker who manipulated stock prices in India in the 1990s, causing a major stock market crash. Here are some details about the Harshad Mehta scam: 
How it happened: Mehta illegally obtained money from banks using fake receipts and created a cycle of fraud. The State Bank of Saurashtra paid Rs 174.95 crore for securities it never received, and the money went to Mehta's accounts instead. 
The impact: The scam was a major incident in India's financial history. 
The aftermath: A book was written about Mehta's life, and a web series and film were also made. The film, The Big Bull, starring Abhishek Bachchan, increased interest in the story.
